Quite simply, every one that intends to write must firstly learn how to summarize, include his ideas, and write in his own words, after thorough reading and researching for a written work. \r\nFurthermore, several other acts that amount to plagiarism include using a still image, motion picture or piece of music in a work you have produced without receiving proper authorization from the original author or content owner, or refusal to appropriately credit the author. “Plagiarism often covers things that are not covered by copyright – ideas, facts and general plot elements are all things that can be plagiarized, at least in certain situations, but generally don’t qualify for copyright protection” (Bailey, 2013).\r\nExperts advise that the best alternative to avoid plagiarism is getting adequate research knowledge and the mastery of effective writing skills. To avoid plagiarism, one must ensure the full reference details of every source used is written in one’s notes while reading and researching for a written work. It is important for writers to learn how to paraphrase, quote, and to properly cite and reference cited materials.\r\n\r\n BIBLIOGRAPHY Works Cited\r\nBailey, J. (2013).

Plagiarismchecker.eu boasts of over 70 databases and well over 3 million sources are available to be compared with your work.\r\n \r\nWHAT ARE THE FOUR TYPES OF PLAGIARISM?\r\nPlagiarism comes in different ways and forms, and should be avoided by all means because of the serious consequences it poses. There are different types of plagiarism but we will focus on the four major types of plagiarism:\r\n1. Direct Plagiarism:  This occurs when you copy a part of someone’s work in its totality and use it for your work without giving the copied work the proper citation. Here the exact same words are used without citing the source of the information. This is the worst kind of plagiarism and should be avoided. This is why it is important to run your work through a plagiarism checker before submitting.\r\n2. Self plagiarism: Self plagiarism is when someone copies their previously  submitted work without the permission of persons involved in that work. It is most frequent in students turning in a work already done by them without the permission of professors involved in that work.\r\n3. Accidental Plagiarism: Here, the plagiarism is not intended but it still carries the same consequences. It happens when someone unintentionally or neglects to quote the source of the information they used  or uses the same kind of words and phrases without proper citation. A good plagiarism checker can be used to identify any plagiarized content in your work for proper citation.\r\n4. Source based plagiarism: This can occur in different ways. It can be as a result of citing a wrong or non existent source  or when all the sources used for a work are not entirely captured in the references given in the work. It can also come in the form of data fabrication.\r\n \r\nCAN YOU GO TO JAIL FOR PLAGIARISM?\r\nPlagiarism is quite a big deal and should be taken seriously because it is a crime with punishment ranging from fine to jail terms. There are legal consequences of plagiarizing a work, as it falls into certain aspects of copyright laws and is a breach. This is why there are tons of plagiarism checker tool out there to enable you detect if your work has some plagiarized contents and to correct immediately.\r\nMost times plagiarism is considered as a misdemeanor, which is punishable by fine. The amount to be fined varies from country to country in line with the law governing such offense, and in some cases, it can earn you a jail term up to one year. In some countries, plagiarism is considered to be a felony under some federal and state laws, and one can face up to ten years jail time; for example if the person that plagiarized another persons work earn more money than the original owner of  the work. With such consequences, it is advisable to make use of the plenty available plagiarism check tools to avoid being fined or even going to jail because of plagiarism.\r\n \r\nWHAT PERCENTAGE OF PLAGIARISM IS ACCEPTABLE?\r\nGenerally plagiarism is completely not allowed and is prohibited, more so as it is not just a civil offense but also considered a criminal offense which can earn you punishments of fine or jail terms.  This is why there is so much emphasis on running your work through a plagiarism scanner to ensure that it is completely safe from any form of plagiarism.\r\nNot withstanding the above, sometimes it difficult to get a 100% free of plagiarism work, which is why some certain percentage of plagiarism is allowed. There are however   no consensus on the amount of plagiarism that can be accepted or overlooked in a manuscript or paper. By popular practices one can say anything below 5% is acceptable,  between 5 to 10 % is not very bad and can be overlooked but if it above 15% then there is a call for concern and that paper should be looked into as it will be deemed to be highly plagiarized. Even in the 15% that is acceptable,  if it is totally from a particular material, then it might be considered as being a plagiarized work . To be on the safe side,  a good plagiarism scanner can be used to reduce traces of plagiarism to the barest minimum.\r\n \r\nWHAT PERCENTAGE OF SIMILARITY IS ACCEPTABLE?\r\nFirst, it is instructive to state that plagiarism and similarity are both different things and shouldn&apos;t be confused with each other.  Plagiarism involves copying some one&apos;s work without giving them the credit by quotation or citation, while similarity includes common word, terms and phrases that might be found in a particular work.\r\nJust like plagiarism, there is no consensus on the acceptable rate of similarity to be allowed in a work, however most opinions are that it is more difficult to avoid similarity than it is to avoid plagiarism. It is almost impossible to completely avoid similar words and phrases especially where such words are popular online. Most persons have pegged the acceptable similarity at 20 to 25 % however the lesser the similarity, the better and more accurate your work will be.  To detect similarity in your work, use a plagiarism scanner to check the work before submitting. The plagiarism checker will indicate how many percent of your work is either plagiarized or similar in text to other works, thereby giving you the opportunity to correct . To avoid incidences of similarity, try to paraphrase your work as much as you can to reduce the chances of similarity.\r\n \r\nWHAT ARE THE 10 TYPES OF PLAGIARISM?\r\nPlagiarism is a popular syndrome for persons that interact with a lot of writing examples, including teachers, students, professors and so on. There are different types of plagiarism and a plagiarism scanner can be used to detect most of them. However, we will be looking at 10 most common types of plagiarism:\r\n1. Clone plagiarism : This is most popular and perhaps the worst kind of plagiarism. Here, there is a verbatim replication of someone&apos;s work with little or no changes, and no proper citation and reference is given to the work copied .\r\n2 . Error plagiarism (404 error): This occurs where someone quotes an incorrect or non existent source as their references.

There are different types of plagiarism but we will focus on the four major types of plagiarism:\r\n1. Direct Plagiarism:  This occurs when you copy a part of someone’s work in its totality and use it for your work without giving the copied work the proper citation. Here the exact same words are used without citing the source of the information. This is the worst kind of plagiarism and should be avoided. This is why it is important to run your work through a plagiarism checker before submitting.\r\n2. Self plagiarism: Self plagiarism is when someone copies their previously  submitted work without the permission of persons involved in that work. It is most frequent in students turning in a work already done by them without the permission of professors involved in that work.\r\n3. Accidental Plagiarism: Here, the plagiarism is not intended but it still carries the same consequences. It happens when someone unintentionally or neglects to quote the source of the information they used  or uses the same kind of words and phrases without proper citation. A good plagiarism checker can be used to identify any plagiarized content in your work for proper citation.\r\n4. Source based plagiarism: This can occur in different ways. It can be as a result of citing a wrong or non existent source  or when all the sources used for a work are not entirely captured in the references given in the work. It can also come in the form of data fabrication.\r\n \r\nCAN YOU GO TO JAIL FOR PLAGIARISM?\r\nPlagiarism is quite a big deal and should be taken seriously because it is a crime with punishment ranging from fine to jail terms. There are legal consequences of plagiarizing a work, as it falls into certain aspects of copyright laws and is a breach. This is why there are tons of plagiarism checker tool out there to enable you detect if your work has some plagiarized contents and to correct immediately.\r\nMost times plagiarism is considered as a misdemeanor, which is punishable by fine. The amount to be fined varies from country to country in line with the law governing such offense, and in some cases, it can earn you a jail term up to one year. In some countries, plagiarism is considered to be a felony under some federal and state laws, and one can face up to ten years jail time; for example if the person that plagiarized another persons work earn more money than the original owner of  the work. With such consequences, it is advisable to make use of the plenty available plagiarism check tools to avoid being fined or even going to jail because of plagiarism.\r\n \r\nWHAT PERCENTAGE OF PLAGIARISM IS ACCEPTABLE?\r\nGenerally plagiarism is completely not allowed and is prohibited, more so as it is not just a civil offense but also considered a criminal offense which can earn you punishments of fine or jail terms.  This is why there is so much emphasis on running your work through a plagiarism scanner to ensure that it is completely safe from any form of plagiarism.\r\nNot withstanding the above, sometimes it difficult to get a 100% free of plagiarism work, which is why some certain percentage of plagiarism is allowed. There are however   no consensus on the amount of plagiarism that can be accepted or overlooked in a manuscript or paper. By popular practices one can say anything below 5% is acceptable,  between 5 to 10 % is not very bad and can be overlooked but if it above 15% then there is a call for concern and that paper should be looked into as it will be deemed to be highly plagiarized. Even in the 15% that is acceptable,  if it is totally from a particular material, then it might be considered as being a plagiarized work . To be on the safe side,  a good plagiarism scanner can be used to reduce traces of plagiarism to the barest minimum.\r\n \r\nWHAT PERCENTAGE OF SIMILARITY IS ACCEPTABLE?\r\nFirst, it is instructive to state that plagiarism and similarity are both different things and shouldn&apos;t be confused with each other.  Plagiarism involves copying some one&apos;s work without giving them the credit by quotation or citation, while similarity includes common word, terms and phrases that might be found in a particular work.\r\nJust like plagiarism, there is no consensus on the acceptable rate of similarity to be allowed in a work, however most opinions are that it is more difficult to avoid similarity than it is to avoid plagiarism. It is almost impossible to completely avoid similar words and phrases especially where such words are popular online. Most persons have pegged the acceptable similarity at 20 to 25 % however the lesser the similarity, the better and more accurate your work will be.  To detect similarity in your work, use a plagiarism scanner to check the work before submitting. The plagiarism checker will indicate how many percent of your work is either plagiarized or similar in text to other works, thereby giving you the opportunity to correct . To avoid incidences of similarity, try to paraphrase your work as much as you can to reduce the chances of similarity.\r\n \r\nWHAT ARE THE 10 TYPES OF PLAGIARISM?\r\nPlagiarism is a popular syndrome for persons that interact with a lot of writing examples, including teachers, students, professors and so on. There are different types of plagiarism and a plagiarism scanner can be used to detect most of them. However, we will be looking at 10 most common types of plagiarism:\r\n1. Clone plagiarism : This is most popular and perhaps the worst kind of plagiarism. Here, there is a verbatim replication of someone&apos;s work with little or no changes, and no proper citation and reference is given to the work copied .\r\n2 . Error plagiarism (404 error): This occurs where someone quotes an incorrect or non existent source as their references. It is usually impossible to trace such citations because it will lead to non existing sources.\r\n3. Self plagiarism : This type of plagiarism is also common.

Find and replace plagiarism : The trick here is to make changes in the  major  keywords and phrases with closely related words, without necessarily changing the whole idea in the context.\r\n6. Remix plagiarism : This kind of plagiarism occurs where a writer copies ideas from different places and puts them all together in a way that is fit and understandable, then claims the work to be his own idea.\r\n7. Aggregator plagiarism : Here, the writer includes the correct references and citations of where he got ideas from, but the problem with this is that the work is almost made up of someone else&apos;s idea and lacks originality.\r\n8. Mashup plagiarism : This type of plagiarism occurs when the writer copies information from lots of sources, joins them together in his own document without properly citing or referencing the various sources.\r\n9.

This is to forestall any issues that might arise as a consequence of infringing copyright and authorship laws, and also to ascertain the integrity of a submitted document and prevent theft of intellectual property. Students that are aware that their universities make use of a plagiarism checker to review their works often personally check their works for plagiarism before submitting, which may not be advisable, especially using free plagiarism checkers online. This is because some websites lure people by claiming to offer free plagiarism checks, but end up selling students’ assignments to other students. In situations like this, the student’s assignment will show up as stolen or plagiarized after submission and review. According to Sidney Kawimbe, students now prefer outsourcing their coursework and assignments, and it is the current academic system and its members that lose in this case, rather than the students or the hired writers. He has this to say: “the ideals that they hold regarding ethics, integrity and academic honors are thrown out the window” (Kawimbe, 2017).\r\nFor a university plagiarism checking tool to be effective and productive, it must be as user-friendly as possible without compromising throughput and speed. Some of the important features of a working university plagiarism checking tool include:\r\nAdd/Remove Users: This feature allows new users to register and be added to the plagiarism checking tool. Old users can log in and use the system while new users can create new account profiles. While this is not an important feature for a personal account on a plagiarism checking system, the system administrator uses this functionality to manage the registration of the end users and authentication of account details, bearing in mind that privileges differ between students&apos; and teachers&apos; accounts on the system.\r\nAssign Submissions: When students submit their documents for plagiarism check on the system, these submissions are assigned to be reviewed by the teachers by a predefined algorithm. This means that the submitted documents are usually assigned to each teacher at the discretion of the system administrator of the university or faculty. For example, a total of 1000 submitted documents to be reviewed for plagiarism might be distributed evenly amongst the 10 registered teachers on the university&apos;s plagiarism checking system or depending on another basis.\r\nStatus of Submission: This feature is exclusive to the teacher&apos;s account as it allows the teacher to see what documents have been assigned to him/her to review, and displays a pop-up message if there are new files assigned for plagiarism check.\r\nAccount Privileges: As stated earlier, privileges of access should vary between students&apos; and teachers&apos; accounts on the university&apos;s plagiarism checking system. A student&apos;s account allows for the submission of documents and access to the final report of the plagiarism review but does not grant permission to review the document for plagiarism which is an exclusive privilege for the teacher account.\r\nStatistics of Usage: This gives an overall metrics of how users frequently use the university plagiarism checking system, such as total number of submissions, percentage of submitted document reviewed, etc.\r\nWorks Cited\r\n BIBLIOGRAPHY Kawimbe, S.

Quite simply, every one that intends to write must firstly learn how to summarize, include his ideas, and write in his own words, after thorough reading and researching for a written work. \r\nFurthermore, several other acts that amount to plagiarism include using a still image, motion picture or piece of music in a work you have produced without receiving proper authorization from the original author or content owner, or refusal to appropriately credit the author. “Plagiarism often covers things that are not covered by copyright – ideas, facts and general plot elements are all things that can be plagiarized, at least in certain situations, but generally don’t qualify for copyright protection” (Bailey, 2013).\r\nExperts advise that the best alternative to avoid plagiarism is getting adequate research knowledge and the mastery of effective writing skills. To avoid plagiarism, one must ensure the full reference details of every source used is written in one’s notes while reading and researching for a written work. It is important for writers to learn how to paraphrase, quote, and to properly cite and reference cited materials.\r\n\r\n BIBLIOGRAPHY Works Cited\r\nBailey, J. (2013).

Hence, manuscripts, articles, essays or blog posts submitted for publishing need to be adequately crosschecked to avoid plagiarism and copyright infringement. It is no longer news that your business image can be severely marred by plagiarism should your website be found to publish duplicate contents.  \r\nGoogle defines plagiarism as the publication of duplicate content, and they have strict measures against websites found guilty of plagiarizing. If your website is found to publish too much of someone else&apos;s content, Google penalizes your website by dropping your site&apos;s URL on search results for your industry keywords. Some popular bloggers and writers have been dropped in Google search ranking because of plagiarism. \r\nNo company wants to invest its time, money and other valuable resources in attaining high ranking in SEO campaigns and then have it dropped down the rank due to claims of plagiarism. This means that the importance of hiring content creators who are reputable, well aware of writing ethics and familiar with the importance of content originality cannot be overemphasized. \r\nWhile preparing documents and other media posts for public usage, website owners, law firms and other business owners need not to only check for the accuracy of the facts presented in these documents but should also take enough time and employ the use of different plagiarism checking software and web applications available today to track the occurrence of plagiarism in submitted contents in a bid to avoid being sanctioned for publishing plagiarized materials. It may initially seem elusive to always avoid plagiarism, especially for start-up businesses without a member with writing expertise. Businesses like this find it difficult to develop their own views, and end up paraphrasing any work they love in a bid to assimilate their arguments. Nonetheless, it is crucial for every business to develop their own voice and become an independent original thinker. If a business is not careful, just what would have been a simple plagiarism can turn out to be copyright infringement, and induce litigation. “Whereas attribution can negate the act of plagiarism, it does not mitigate copyright infringement which can occur whether or not the author of a work has been properly identified” (Fishman, 2009).\r\nEven though manual checks for plagiarism often take time, automated plagiarism checkers available online are usually faster and can accurately highlight plagiarized contents, so they can be promptly corrected. The time it takes to review a submitted piece for plagiarism will eventually be worth it when the originality of your articles and posts can be verified.\r\nWorks Cited\r\n BIBLIOGRAPHY Fishman, T. (2009). &quot;We know it when we see it&quot; is not good enough: toward a standard definition of plagiarism that transcends theft, fraud, and copyright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'file', 1, 0, 0, '2019-10-15 23:40:17', '2019-10-15 23:40:30'),

This is to forestall any issues that might arise as a consequence of infringing copyright and authorship laws, and also to ascertain the integrity of a submitted document and prevent theft of intellectual property. Students that are aware that their universities make use of a plagiarism checker to review their works often personally check their works for plagiarism before submitting, which may not be advisable, especially using free plagiarism checkers online. This is because some websites lure people by claiming to offer free plagiarism checks, but end up selling students’ assignments to other students. In situations like this, the student’s assignment will show up as stolen or plagiarized after submission and review. According to Sidney Kawimbe, students now prefer outsourcing their coursework and assignments, and it is the current academic system and its members that lose in this case, rather than the students or the hired writers. He has this to say: “the ideals that they hold regarding ethics, integrity and academic honors are thrown out the window” (Kawimbe, 2017).\r\nFor a university plagiarism checking tool to be effective and productive, it must be as user-friendly as possible without compromising throughput and speed. Some of the important features of a working university plagiarism checking tool include:\r\nAdd/Remove Users: This feature allows new users to register and be added to the plagiarism checking tool. Old users can log in and use the system while new users can create new account profiles. While this is not an important feature for a personal account on a plagiarism checking system, the system administrator uses this functionality to manage the registration of the end users and authentication of account details, bearing in mind that privileges differ between students&apos; and teachers&apos; accounts on the system.\r\nAssign Submissions: When students submit their documents for plagiarism check on the system, these submissions are assigned to be reviewed by the teachers by a predefined algorithm. This means that the submitted documents are usually assigned to each teacher at the discretion of the system administrator of the university or faculty. For example, a total of 1000 submitted documents to be reviewed for plagiarism might be distributed evenly amongst the 10 registered teachers on the university&apos;s plagiarism checking system or depending on another basis.\r\nStatus of Submission: This feature is exclusive to the teacher&apos;s account as it allows the teacher to see what documents have been assigned to him/her to review, and displays a pop-up message if there are new files assigned for plagiarism check.\r\nAccount Privileges: As stated earlier, privileges of access should vary between students&apos; and teachers&apos; accounts on the university&apos;s plagiarism checking system. A student&apos;s account allows for the submission of documents and access to the final report of the plagiarism review but does not grant permission to review the document for plagiarism which is an exclusive privilege for the teacher account.\r\nStatistics of Usage: This gives an overall metrics of how users frequently use the university plagiarism checking system, such as total number of submissions, percentage of submitted document reviewed, etc.\r\nWorks Cited\r\n BIBLIOGRAPHY Kawimbe, S.
